# TrainTime_Scheduler

With the TrainTime_Scheduler application users can complete a form with relevant information such as the train name, train destination, frequency, and the first train time (military time). With incorporation of Firebase, when the user clicks on the submit button, the full train schedule is displayed in real time, including how many minutes away the train is and when the next train is coming.
